# Fisher Information in pairwise isotropic Gaussian-Markov random fields
Python code for the paper "On the numerical approximation of geodesic distances between pairwise isotropic Gaussian-Markov random fields"

Random fields are among the mathematical models used in the study of non-deterministic and non-linear complex systems. A fundamental aspect in the characterization of such models is to define intrinsic properties and to understand how these measures change. In this paper, we propose an information-geometric framework to analyze Gaussian-Markov random fields (GMRF's) by the definition of a Fisher information based space. With this approach, it is possible to measure the variations in each component of the metric tensor that equips the underlying parametric space, when visiting different entropic states. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we propose a method based on infinitesimal displacements to approximate the geodesic distance between two systems operating in different regimes, represented by two points in the parametric space. Moreover, we derive an expression for the KL-divergence (relative entropy) between two GMRF models, showing that, it works reasonably well for nearby models in the manifold, but it is not accurate when the models drift apart. Finally, information cycles that relate components of the metric tensor and the system's entropy reveals an asymmetric pattern of evolution when the system moves towards different entropic states, indicating that the simple interaction between several Gaussian random variables can lead to the emergence of an intrinsic notion of time in the evolution of a random field, based in the geometric properties of its parametric space.
